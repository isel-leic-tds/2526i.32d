/**
 * Represents coordinates of the sliding puzzle.
 *
 * IMPORTANT DESIGN NOTE:
 * Coordinates MUST always be valid within the context of a puzzle. This means that row and column are always in
 * interval 0 until side, where side is the side of the puzzle. This is ensured by validating the coordinates
 * upon creation by the puzzle instance.
 *
 * To control the creation of coordinates to ensure they are always valid within the context of a puzzle, the
 * constructor is made internal so that coordinates can only be created within the module. Unfortunately, in Kotlin
 * we cannot ensure that coordinates are not instantiated from elsewhere in the module, but we can document it here.
 *
 * @property row The row index of the coordinate.
 * @property column The column index of the coordinate.
 * @constructor Creates a new instance of Coordinate.
